@article{Soberon2004,
abstract = {Recently, advances in information technology and an increased willingness to share primary biodiversity data are enabling unprecedented access to it. By combining presences of species data with electronic cartography via a number of algorithms, estimating niches of species and their areas of distribution becomes feasible at resolutions one to three orders of magnitude higher than it was possible a few years ago. Some examples of the power of that technique are presented. For the method to work, limitations such as lack of high-quality taxonomic determination, precise georeferencing of the data and availability of high-quality and updated taxonomic treatments of the groups must be overcome. These are discussed, together with comments on the potential of these biodiversity informatics techniques not only for fundamental studies but also as a way for developing countries to apply state of the art bioinformatic methods and large quantities of data, in practical ways, to tackle issues of biodiversity management.},

Because biodiversity data are frequently ‘harvested'—i.e. not collected by the researcher for that particular study, but obtained from data aggregators such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—researchers need to be aware of strengths and weaknesses of their data before they venture into further analysis. R is becoming a lingua franca of data exploration and analysis.

@article{Ondov2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A critical output of metagenomic studies is the estimation of abundances of taxonomical or functional groups. The inherent uncertainty in assignments to these groups makes it important to consider both their hierarchical contexts and their prediction confidence. The current tools for visualizing metagenomic data, however, omit or distort quantitative hierarchical relationships and lack the facility for displaying secondary variables.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present Krona, a new visualization tool that allows intuitive exploration of relative abundances and confidences within the complex hierarchies of metagenomic classifications. Krona combines a variant of radial, space-filling displays with parametric coloring and interactive polar-coordinate zooming. The HTML5 and JavaScript implementation enables fully interactive charts that can be explored with any modern Web browser, without the need for installed software or plug-ins. This Web-based architecture also allows each chart to be an independent document, making them easy to share via e-mail or post to a standard Web server. To illustrate Krona's utility, we describe its application to various metagenomic data sets and its compatibility with popular metagenomic analysis tools.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Krona is both a powerful metagenomic visualization tool and a demonstration of the potential of HTML5 for highly accessible bioinformatic visualizations. Its rich and interactive displays facilitate more informed interpretations of metagenomic analyses, while its implementation as a browser-based application makes it extremely portable and easily adopted into existing analysis packages. Both the Krona rendering code and conversion tools are freely available under a BSD open-source license, and available from: http://krona.sourceforge.net.},

@article{Huson2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research in evolution requires software for visualizing and editing phylogenetic trees, for increasingly very large datasets, such as arise in expression analysis or metagenomics, for example. It would be desirable to have a program that provides these services in an efficient and user-friendly way, and that can be easily installed and run on all major operating systems. Although a large number of tree visualization tools are freely available, some as a part of more comprehensive analysis packages, all have drawbacks in one or more domains. They either lack some of the standard tree visualization techniques or basic graphics and editing features, or they are restricted to small trees containing only tens of thousands of taxa. Moreover, many programs are difficult to install or are not available for all common operating systems. RESULTS: We have developed a new program, Dendroscope, for the interactive visualization and navigation of phylogenetic trees. The program provides all standard tree visualizations and is optimized to run interactively on trees containing hundreds of thousands of taxa. The program provides tree editing and graphics export capabilities. To support the inspection of large trees, Dendroscope offers a magnification tool. The software is written in Java 1.4 and installers are provided for Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows XP. CONCLUSION: Dendroscope is a user-friendly program for visualizing and navigating phylogenetic trees, for both small and large datasets.},

abstract = {Several institutions in the world perform the collection of data about animals from various species, forming collections of specimens. This data contains various information about these animals, like its taxonomic classification, weight, length, color, and many others. The location where the animals were found is other available information. Many of these collections are stored in spreadsheets from calculating programs, for example, and this is not a properly form to do that. Elsewhere, some collection are stored in information systems owned by its institutions; some of this systems can show the specimens' data for the general public. The modeling of a taxonomic structure in a database is not trivial, because it is a model that is constantly altered. So, it should be supported not only the storage of specimens, but a set of information about the taxonomic classification, and should be possible to change this information any time. A Non-Governmental Organization, Mam{\'{i}}feros RS, proposed us to develop a system where they could store information about the mammals collected in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and also visualize the geographical distribution of these animals in a map of the state. It should be also possible to display these data to the general public through access to the system via internet. Considering the interesting aspects of such development, which would allow us to explore data modeling and visualization problems, we established as a goal for present work to design and develop a web application to manage and display information about taxonomic collections. The system has been validated by the biologist since the first prototypes and soon will be installed in the NGO website.},

Several RSF systems and tools have been developed to date, each with varying degrees of support for interactive operations such as selection and navigation. In this paper, we describe what we believe to be a complete set of desirable operations on hierarchical structures. We then present InterRing, an RSF hierarchy visualization system that supports a significantly more extensive set of these operations than prior systems. In particular, InterRing supports multifocus distortions, interactive hierarchy reconfiguration, and both semiautomated and manual selection. We show the power and utility of these and other operations, and describe our ongoing efforts to evaluate their effectiveness and usability. },

The two tools examined implement space-filling methodologies, one rectangular, the Treemap method, and one circular, the Sunburst method. Participants performed typical file/directory search and analysis tasks using the two tools. In general, performance trends favored the Sunburst tool with respect to correct task performance, particularly on initial use. Performance with Treemap tended to improve over time and use, suggesting a greater learning cost that was partially recouped over time. Each tool afforded somewhat different search strategies, which also appeared to influence performance. Finally, participants strongly preferred the Sunburst tool, citing better ability to convey structure and hierarchy.},

Even more surprising is that there are few contenders for this title, and this question seems not to have been raised before. This article traces some of the developments in the history of this graphical method, the origin of the term scatterplot, the role it has played in the history of science, and some of its modern descendants.

abstract = {Illustrative parallel coordinates (IPC) is a suite of artistic rendering techniques for augmenting and improving parallel coordinate (PC) visualizations. IPC techniques can be used to convey a large amount of information about a multidimensional dataset in a small area of the screen through the following approaches: (a) edge-bundling through splines; (b) visualization of “branched ” clusters to reveal the distribution of the data; (c) opacity-based hints to show cluster density; (d) opacity and shading effects to illustrate local line density on the parallel axes; and (e) silhouettes, shadows and halos to help the eye distinguish between overlapping clusters. Thus, the primary goal of this work is to convey as much information as possible in a manner that is aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand for non-experts.},

%protovis

@article{Bostock2009,
abstract = {Despite myriad tools for visualizing data, there remains a gap between the notational efficiency of high-level visualization systems and the expressiveness and accessibility of low-level graphical systems. Powerful visualization systems may be inflexible or impose abstractions foreign to visual thinking, while graphical systems such as rendering APIs and vector-based drawing programs are tedious for complex work. We argue that an easy-to-use graphical system tailored for visualization is needed. In response, we contribute Protovis, an extensible toolkit for constructing visualizations by composing simple graphical primitives. In Protovis, designers specify visualizations as a hierarchy of marks with visual properties defined as functions of data. This representation achieves a level of expressiveness comparable to low-level graphics systems, while improving efficiency--the effort required to specify a visualization--and accessibility--the effort required to learn and modify the representation. We substantiate this claim through a diverse collection of examples and comparative analysis with popular visualization tools.},

@article{Likert1932,
abstract = {The project conceived in 1929 by Gardner Murphy and the writer aimed first to present a wide array of problems having to do with five major "attitude areas"—international relations, race relations, economic conflict, political conflict, and religion. The kind of questionnaire material falls into four classes: yes-no, multiple choice, propositions to be responded to by degrees of approval, and a series of brief newspaper narratives to be approved or disapproved in various degrees. The monograph aims to describe a technique rather than to give results. The appendix, covering ten pages, shows the method of constructing an attitude scale. A bibliography is also given.},

$SUS

@article{Brooke1996,
abstract = {Usability does not exist in any absolute sense; it can only be defined with reference to particular contexts. This, in turn, means that there are no absolute measures of usability, since, if the usability of an artefact is defined by the context in which that artefact is used, measures of usability must of necessity be defined by that context too. Despite this, there is a need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for " quick and dirty " methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation. This chapter describes the System Usability Scale (SUS) a reliable, low-cost usability scale that can be used for global assessments of systems usability.},
